## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why does Vizora need so many permissions?**
A: Each permission serves a specific purpose:
- Usage Stats: Track app usage
- Accessibility: Monitor and block apps
- Overlay: Show timer alerts
- Device Admin: Prevent accidental uninstall

**Q: Does Vizora collect my data?**
A: No! All data stays on your device. Vizora has no internet permission and cannot send data anywhere.

**Q: Why isn't my launcher app showing?**
A: Vizora automatically filters out your default launcher to show only meaningful usage data.

**Q: Can I export my data?**
A: Export/import functionality has been removed to keep the app simple and focused on core features.

**Q: What's the minimum usage time threshold?**
A: Apps must be used for at least 3 minutes to appear in statistics. This filters out accidental opens.
